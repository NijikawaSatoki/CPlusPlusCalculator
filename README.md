# CPlusPlusCalculator
A multi-function calculator written in C++ designed to run in the terminal.
## What can it do?
This section explains the different mathematical operations this calculator.\
**Addition**: Adds the two operands, e.g. 2 + 8 (returns `10`). This is formatted as `a+b`.\
**Subtraction**: Subtracts the second operand from the first, e.g. 2 - 8 (returns `-6`). This is formatted as `a-b`.\
**Multiplication**: Multiplies the two operands together, e.g. 2 ร 8 (returns `16`). This is formatted as `a*b`.\
**Division**: Divides the first operand by the second, e.g. 2 รท 8 (returns `0.24`). This is formatted as `a/b`.\
**Modulus**: Retrieves the remainder of a division operation, e.g. 2 mod 8 (returns `2`). This is formatted as `a%b`.\
**Exponentiation**: Multiplies the base number by itself as many times as stated by the exponent, e.g. 2<sup>8</sup> (returns `256`). This is formatted as `a^b`.
## Installation
Simply grab the code files under your locale of choice and compile them into a functional executable.\
**NOTE FOR CYGWIN AND MSYS2 USERS:** Unfortunately, the only locale that will work correctly is en-US, due to Windows having really terrible UTF-8 support in terminal shells.
### Compiling
This code can be compiled with your compiler of choice. (You need to be in the directory where you placed the code!)\
For GCC users:\
`$ g++ CalculatorMain.cpp Calculator.cpp -o Calculator -Wall`\
For Clang users:\
`$ clang++ CalculatorMain.cpp Calculator.cpp -o Calculator`
## Running
After the code is compiled with your compiler of choice, just enter into the terminal:\
`$ ./Calculator`\
Have fun doing math!
